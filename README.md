# citibike
I like Citibike so I wanted to take a look at Citibike data. This is for a personal project. 

Some of the things I want to try and do:
- Find interesting patterns in citibike usage, such as:
    - Do people really use more electic bikes for bridge trips?
    - Which paths (start/end stations) are the most popular?
    - Are there any interesting commuting patterns (e.g. people taking the train to work in the morning but biking home later)

Long-term goals:
- Create some kind of Tableau reporting here
- Implement other things (sqlfluff, github actions, other cool stuff)
